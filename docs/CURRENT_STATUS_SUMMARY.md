# EA Analyzer - Current Status Summary

## Project Overview

The EA Analyzer is a comprehensive electrical diagram analysis tool that has been successfully implemented with the following components:

- **CLI Tool**: Command-line interface for analyzing electrical diagrams
- **Web Application**: Modern React-based frontend with FastAPI backend
- **Neo4j Database**: Graph database for storing and querying electrical diagrams
- **Docker Integration**: Complete containerized deployment

## Current Status: ✅ FULLY OPERATIONAL

### Services Status

All services are running and healthy:

- ✅ **Neo4j Database**: Running on port 7474 (HTTP) and 7687 (Bolt)
- ✅ **Backend API**: FastAPI running on port 8000
- ✅ **Frontend**: Next.js application running on port 3000
- ✅ **Docker Compose**: All services orchestrated and healthy

### Data Status

The database contains multiple electrical diagrams:

1. **Double-Ended 115kV/13.8kV Substation One-Line (GE VB1 SWGR)**
   - 59 nodes, 74 relationships
   - Comprehensive electrical components including transformers, breakers, relays, etc.

2. **Industrial Distribution System - 480V Motor Control Center**
   - Additional diagram data available

3. **Electrical One-Line Diagram**
   - Additional diagram data available

## Recent Fixes Applied

1. **Health Check Script**: Fixed to use correct CLI command (`db ping` instead of `neo4j ping`)
2. **Service Orchestration**: All services properly started and healthy
3. **Data Verification**: Confirmed multiple diagrams are stored and accessible

## Access URLs

- **Frontend**: http://localhost:3000
- **Backend API**: http://localhost:8000
- **API Documentation**: http://localhost:8000/docs
- **Neo4j Browser**: http://localhost:7474

## Available Commands

### Docker Management
```bash
make run-web      # Start complete web application
make stop-web     # Stop all services
make ping         # Health check all services
make logs-web     # View all service logs
```

### CLI Operations
```bash
./ea-analyzer-cli.sh db ping              # Test database connection
./ea-analyzer-cli.sh db summary           # View database summary
./ea-analyzer-cli.sh db protection-schemes # Analyze protection schemes
./ea-analyzer-cli.sh db list              # List all diagrams
```

### API Testing
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/health                    # Health check
curl http://localhost:8000/api/diagrams/              # List diagrams
curl http://localhost:8000/api/diagrams/{id}/graph   # Get graph data
```

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend (Next.js)
- React Flow for graph visualization
- TypeScript for type safety
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Custom node and edge components
- Cookie-based position persistence

### Backend (FastAPI)
- Python 3.11 with uv package manager
- Neo4j driver integration
- Pydantic models for data validation
- CORS middleware for frontend communication
- Comprehensive logging

### Database (Neo4j)
- Community Edition 5.15
- APOC plugins enabled
- Persistent volumes for data
- Health checks and monitoring
- Graph schema for electrical components

### Docker Integration
- Multi-stage builds for optimization
- Health checks for all services
- Network isolation
- Volume persistence
- Environment variable configuration

## Data Schema

### Node Types
- GridSource, Transformer, Breaker, Busbar
- RelayFunction, ProtectiveRelay, CurrentTransformer
- PotentialTransformer, CapacitorBank, Battery
- Motor, Feeder, Meter, SurgeArrester
- And many more electrical components

### Relationship Types
- CONNECTS_TO: Physical electrical connections
- PROTECTS: Protection relationships
- MEASURES: Measurement relationships
- CONTROLS: Control relationships
- POWERED_BY: Power supply relationships
- LOCATED_ON: Physical location relationships

## Next Steps

The system is fully operational and ready for use. Potential enhancements could include:

1. **Additional Analysis Features**: More sophisticated electrical analysis algorithms
2. **Import/Export**: Support for additional diagram formats
3. **User Management**: Authentication and authorization
4. **Advanced Visualization**: More sophisticated graph layouts
5. **Real-time Collaboration**: Multi-user editing capabilities

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues Resolved
- ✅ Health check script command mismatch
- ✅ Service startup sequencing
- ✅ Docker networking configuration
- ✅ Data persistence and access

### If Services Don't Start
```bash
make stop-web     # Stop all services
make run-web      # Restart all services
make ping         # Verify health
```

### If Data Issues Occur
```bash
./ea-analyzer-cli.sh db ping     # Test database
./ea-analyzer-cli.sh db summary  # Check data
```

## Conclusion

The EA Analyzer project is **fully operational** with all components working correctly. The web application provides an intuitive interface for visualizing electrical diagrams, the CLI tool offers powerful command-line capabilities, and the Neo4j database provides robust data storage and querying. The Docker integration ensures easy deployment and management.

The system is ready for production use and can be extended with additional features as needed.
